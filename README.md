# CR-Chronicles-Narrative-Driven-Systems-Prototype
A 3D story-based fan game set in the Clash Royale universe, built in Unity (C#). This project focuses on event-driven architecture and linear state management to deliver a scripted narrative experience.

Technical Implementation
Linear State Controller: Developed a centralized manager to handle narrative transitions, ensuring game-world triggers (e.g., character dialogue, camera transitions) execute in the correct sequence.

Trigger-Based Event System: Utilized Unity’s Event System and 3D Colliders to initiate scripted sequences, decoupling narrative logic from the player-controller code.

Character Controller & Camera Rigging: Implemented a custom 3D movement system and scripted camera behaviors to guide the player’s perspective through key story beats.

Asset Integration & Environment Design: Optimized the pipeline for importing and rendering 3D mobile-style assets, maintaining a consistent aesthetic while managing real-time performance.
